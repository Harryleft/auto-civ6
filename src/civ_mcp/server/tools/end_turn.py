    Make sure you've moved all units, set production, and chosen research

    All 5 reflection parameters are required and must be non-empty.
    These form the per-turn diary — your persistent memory across sessions:
        tactical: What happened this turn — combat, movements, improvements.
        strategic: Current standing vs rivals — yields, city count, victory path.
        tooling: Tool issues or observations. Write "No issues" if none.
        planning: Concrete actions for the next 5-10 turns.
        hypothesis: Predictions — enemy behavior, resource needs, timelines.

    IMPORTANT: Reflections are recorded BEFORE the AI processes its turn.
    Anything that surfaces after end_turn (diplomacy proposals, AI movements,
    events reported in the turn result) belongs in the NEXT turn's diary.
    If end_turn is blocked and you call it again after resolving the blocker,
    the diary entry from the first call is kept — do not repeat reflections.
